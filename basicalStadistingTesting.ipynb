    "# Stadistic testing\n",
    "In this notebooke we're going review some of the basics of statistical testing in python. We're going to talk about hypotesis testing, statistical significance, and using scipy to run student's t-tests.\n",
    "We use statistics in a lot of different ways in data science, and on this lectura, I want to refresh you knowledge of hypothesis testing, which is a core data analysis activity behind experimentation. The goal of hypothesis is to determine if, for instance, the two different conditions we have in an experiment have resulted in different impacts.\n",
    "Now, scipy is an interesting cikkectuib if libraries fo data science and you'll use most or perpahs all of these libraries. It incluedes numpy and pandas, but also plotting libraries such as matplotlib, and a number of scientific library functions as well."

Our testing method is to determine whether the null hypothesis is true or not. If we find that there is a difference between groups, then we can reject the null hypothesis and we accept our alternative."

It allows us to form the alternative hypothesis (\"These are different\") as well as the null hypothesis (\"These are the same\") and then test that null hypothesis. When doing hypothesis testing, we have to choose a significance level as a threshold for how much of a chance we're willing to accept. This significance level is typically called alpha. For this example, Let's use a threshold of 0.05 for our alpha or 5%. Now this is a commonly used number but it's really quite arbitrary.\n",

The result of ttest_index() are the t-statistic and a p-value. It's this latter value, the probability, which is most important to us, as it indicates the chance (between 0 and 1) of our null hypothesis being True."

    "Ok, so it looks like in this data we do not have enough evidence to suggest the populations differ with respect to grade. Let's take a look those p-values for a moment though, because they are saying things that can inform experimental design down the road. For instance, one of the assignments, assignment 3, has a p-value around 0.1. This means that if we accepted a level of chance similarity of 11% this would have been considered statistically significant. As a research, this would suggest to me that there is somenthing here worth considering following up on. For instance, if we had a small number of participants (we don't) or if there was something unique about this assignment as it relates to our experiment (whatever it was) then there may be followup experiments we could run.\n",

One issue with p-values is that as you run more tests are likely to get a value which is statistically significant just by chance."
