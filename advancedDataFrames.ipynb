    "## Merging DataFrames\n",
    "Inthis notebook we're going to address how you can bring multiple dataframe objects together, either by merging them horizontally, or by concatenating them vertically. Before we jump into the code, we need to address a little relational theory and to get some language convetions down. A Venn Diagram is traditionally used to show set membership. For example, the circle on the left is the population of students at a university. The circle on the right is the population of staff at university. And the overlapping regio un this middle are all of those students who are also staff. Maybe these students run tutorials for a course, or grade assignments, or engage in running research experiments. So, this diagram shows two populations whom we nught have data about, but there is overlap between those populations.\n",
    "When it comes to translation this pandas, we can think of the case where we might have these two populations as indices in separate DataFrames, maybe with the label of PersonName. When we want to join the DataFrames together, we have some choices to maje, First what if we want a listo of all the people regardless of whether they're staff or student, and all of the inforamtion we can get of them? In database terminology, this is called a full outer join. And in ser theory, it's called a union. In the Venn diagram, it represents everyone in any circle.\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN (UNION) All elements of both sets.\n",
    "It's quite possible though that we only want those people who we hace maximum information for, these people who are both staff and students. Maybe being a staff member and a studen involves getting a tuition waiver, and we want to calculate the cost of this. In database terminology, this is called an inner join. Or in set theory, the intersection.\n",
    "INNER JOIN (INTERSECTION) Only elments are in both sets."
